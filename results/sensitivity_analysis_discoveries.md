# Sector Volatility Analysis & Sensitivity Testing Summary

## Key Findings:

**Sector Volatility Reality Check:**
- Nifty index volatility (2018-2025): Extremely low (0.05%-0.89% range)
- 98.7% of days had volatility below 5%
- All values remained below 15% threshold
- Market conditions were abnormally stable during test period

**Sensitivity Analysis Issue:**
- Parameter: `sector_vol_threshold` (5.0% to 15.0% range)
- Result: Identical performance across all thresholds
- Root cause: Regime filter never activated (sector_vol always < threshold)
- Impact: Parameter has zero effect on strategy during this period

## Technical Details:

**Data Characteristics:**
- Min volatility: 0.05%, Max: 0.89%, Mean: 0.15%
- 95th percentile: 0.27% (still very low)
- Total trading days: 1,888, Low volatility days: 1,864

**Filter Behavior:**
- RegimeGuard condition: `signal.sector_vol > threshold`
- Actual values: Always false for thresholds ≥ 5%
- Result: No signals filtered, identical backtest results

## Recommendations:

1. **Use different parameter** for sensitivity analysis (e.g., `hurst_threshold`, `rsi_threshold`)
2. **Consider more volatile period** (2020-2022 COVID era)
3. **Document this finding** - sector_vol_threshold ineffective in low-volatility markets

## Conclusion:

The sensitivity analysis revealed that sector volatility filtering is irrelevant for the 2018-2025 period due to exceptionally stable market conditions. This is valuable insight for strategy robustness assessment.

## Hurst Threshold Analysis & Sensitivity Testing Summary

**Key Findings:**
- **Optimal threshold: 0.45** - Best balance of selectivity and profitability
- **Performance metrics**: 64.71% win rate, 2.60 profit factor, 5.00% average return
- **Trade frequency pattern**: Increases dramatically (0→181 trades) as threshold rises
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Profit factor peaks at 0.45, then declines despite more trades

**Technical Analysis:**
- **0.35-0.40**: Too restrictive, poor/missing signals
- **0.45**: Sweet spot with highest quality signals
- **0.50-0.60**: More trades but declining win rates and profit factors
- **Risk consideration**: Standard deviation increases with trade frequency

**Practical Insights:**
- Validates principle: Fewer high-quality trades beat many mediocre ones
- 0.45 threshold captures best market regime signals
- Manageable 17 trades vs excessive 181 trades at higher thresholds

## RSI Threshold Analysis & Sensitivity Testing Summary

**Key Findings:**
- **Optimal threshold: 32-34** - Best balance of win rate and trade frequency
- **Performance pattern**: Exceptional quality at restrictive levels, declining as threshold increases
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Tighter thresholds yield fewer but higher-quality signals

**Technical Analysis:**
- **RSI 30**: 10 trades, 90% win rate, 8.68 profit factor, 10.98% avg return (exceptional but rare)
- **RSI 32-34**: 13-16 trades, 68-69% win rates, 2.83 profit factors, 5.59-6.17% avg returns (sweet spot)
- **RSI 36-40**: 18-22 trades, 59-61% win rates, 2.39-2.85 profit factors, 4.46-5.47% avg returns (diminishing quality)

**Practical Insights:**
- Confirms principle: Signal quality trumps frequency
- RSI 32-34 offers optimal risk-adjusted returns
- Tighter thresholds (30) may miss opportunities despite superior metrics
- Looser thresholds (36+) increase false signals and reduce edge

## ATR Stop Loss Multiplier Analysis & Sensitivity Testing Summary

**Key Findings:**
- **Optimal multiplier: 2.25** - Best balance of profit factor and average return
- **Performance pattern**: Profit factor peaks at 2.25, then declines despite stable win rates
- **Risk/Reward Trade-off**: Tighter stops reduce volatility but may exit winners early

**Technical Analysis:**
- **ATR 2.0**: 17 trades, 58.82% win rate, 2.68 profit factor, 4.72% avg return, 10.70% std dev (conservative)
- **ATR 2.25**: 17 trades, 64.71% win rate, 2.88 profit factor, 5.31% avg return, 10.92% std dev (optimal)
- **ATR 2.5**: 17 trades, 64.71% win rate, 2.60 profit factor, 5.00% avg return, 11.35% std dev (current default)
- **ATR 2.75-3.0**: 17 trades, 64.71% win rate, 2.37-2.17 profit factors, 4.70-4.39% avg returns, 11.78-12.22% std dev (declining quality)

**Practical Insights:**
- Confirms risk management importance: Stop placement affects outcome quality
- ATR 2.25 offers highest profit factor (2.88) and return (5.31%)
- Wider stops (3.0) increase volatility without proportional return benefit
- Consistent trade count suggests entry signals drive frequency, exits determine quality

**Practical Insights:**
- Confirms mean reversion principle: Shorter lookbacks capture true reversion signals
- BB 15-17 offer highest profit factors (2.75-3.00) and returns (5.12-5.30%)
- Longer lengths (21+) dilute signal quality with historical noise
- Trade frequency increases with length but quality decreases proportionally

## Final Complete Analysis Summary

**What Works:**
- Hurst threshold (0.45): Superior regime filtering (65% win rate, 2.6 profit factor)
- RSI threshold (32-34): Optimal signal generation (68-69% win rates, 2.83 profit factors)
- ATR stop loss multiplier (2.25): Best risk management (64.71% win rate, 2.88 profit factor, 5.31% avg return)
- BB length (15-17): Pure mean reversion signals (65-67% win rates, 2.75-3.00 profit factors, 5.12-5.30% avg returns)
- RSI length (16): Exceptional momentum timing (78.57% win rate, 5.75 profit factor, 8.10% avg return)
- Parameter robustness: Hurst length (80-120) and exit days (10-30) show identical performance
- Quality-focused approach: Selective trading beats high frequency

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Sector volatility threshold: Ineffective in stable markets (never activated)
- Overly restrictive thresholds: Miss profitable opportunities
- High-frequency trading: Declining quality as thresholds loosen
- Wide stop losses (3.0+): Increased volatility without return benefit
- Long BB lengths (21+): Signal dilution with historical noise
- Parameter sensitivity: Some parameters show no impact due to threshold dominance

**Final Recommendation:** Use Hurst 0.45 + RSI 16 + ATR 2.25 + BB 15-17 + Hurst length 100 (default) + exit days 20 (default) for fully optimized, robust strategy.
