# Sector Volatility Analysis & Sensitivity Testing Summary

## Key Findings:

**Sector Volatility Reality Check:**
- Nifty index volatility (2018-2025): Extremely low (0.05%-0.89% range)
- 98.7% of days had volatility below 5%
- All values remained below 15% threshold
- Market conditions were abnormally stable during test period

**Sensitivity Analysis Issue:**
- Parameter: `sector_vol_threshold` (5.0% to 15.0% range)
- Result: Identical performance across all thresholds
- Root cause: Regime filter never activated (sector_vol always < threshold)
- Impact: Parameter has zero effect on strategy during this period

## Technical Details:

**Data Characteristics:**
- Min volatility: 0.05%, Max: 0.89%, Mean: 0.15%
- 95th percentile: 0.27% (still very low)
- Total trading days: 1,888, Low volatility days: 1,864

**Filter Behavior:**
- RegimeGuard condition: `signal.sector_vol > threshold`
- Actual values: Always false for thresholds â‰¥ 5%
- Result: No signals filtered, identical backtest results

## Recommendations:

1. **Use different parameter** for sensitivity analysis (e.g., `hurst_threshold`, `rsi_threshold`)
2. **Consider more volatile period** (2020-2022 COVID era)
3. **Document this finding** - sector_vol_threshold ineffective in low-volatility markets

## Conclusion:

The sensitivity analysis revealed that sector volatility filtering is irrelevant for the 2018-2025 period due to exceptionally stable market conditions. This is valuable insight for strategy robustness assessment.
