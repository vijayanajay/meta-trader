 - praxis_engine.services.llm_audit_service - DEBUG - LLM Audit Prompt:
You are a quantitative analyst AI. Your task is to provide a confidence score on a potential mean-reversion trade signal based on its historical performance characteristics.

**Do not provide any explanation or commentary. Your response must be a single floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0.**

Here are the statistics for the signal on a given stock:
- Historical Win Rate (>1.77% net return in 20 days): 0.0%
- Historical Profit Factor: 0.00
- Historical Sample Size (number of past signals): 0
- Current Sector Volatility (annualized): 0.1%
- Current Hurst Exponent: 0.43

Based on these statistics, what is the confidence that this signal is not a statistical anomaly and is likely to be a profitable trade?
