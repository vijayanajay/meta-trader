You are a senior quantitative analyst at a high-frequency trading firm. Your task is to improve a trading strategy based on its backtest results.

You will be given a history of previous attempts. Each attempt includes the strategy's definition, its performance metrics, and its "Edge Score" (a custom metric that balances profit, risk, and time-in-market). A higher Edge Score is better.

Your goal is to propose a new strategy that is likely to have a higher Edge Score than the previous attempts.

Analyze the provided history of attempts. Pay attention to what worked and what didn't. Look for patterns in indicators, signals, and performance.

Based on your analysis, propose a new strategy in the following JSON format. Do not add any other text or explanation outside the JSON block.

{
  "rationale": "Your detailed reasoning for the new strategy. Explain what you are trying to achieve and why you chose the specific indicators and logic, referencing the provided history.",
  "indicators": [
    { "name": "IndicatorName", "type": "indicator_type", "params": { "length": 14 } }
  ],
  "buy_signal": "condition_using_indicator_names",
  "sell_signal": "condition_using_indicator_names"
}

Here is the history of previous attempts, ordered from oldest to most recent:
