# Epic 11 Verification Report

This document provides a formal verification of the implementation of Epic 11 (Tasks 40-43) as requested.

---

### Task 40: Extend the `Trade` Model for Deeper Analysis

*   **Requirement:** Modify the `Trade` model in `praxis_engine/core/models.py` to include new fields for deeper analysis (`exit_reason`, scores, entry stats, etc.).
*   **Verification:** The file `praxis_engine/core/models.py` was reviewed. The `Trade` Pydantic model now contains all the specified fields.
    ```python
    class Trade(BaseModel):
        # ... existing fields ...
        exit_reason: str
        liquidity_score: float
        regime_score: float
        stat_score: float
        composite_score: float
        entry_hurst: float
        entry_adf_p_value: float
        entry_sector_vol: float
        # ... config fields ...
    ```
*   **Status:** ✅ **PASS**

### Task 41: Refactor `_determine_exit` to Return Exit Reason

*   **Requirement:** Change the `_determine_exit` method in `praxis_engine/core/orchestrator.py` to return the reason for the exit as a string.
*   **Verification:** The file `praxis_engine/core/orchestrator.py` was reviewed. The `_determine_exit` method's signature is now `-> Tuple[Optional[pd.Timestamp], Optional[float], str]`, and its return statements correctly include the reason string (e.g., `"ATR_STOP_LOSS"`, `"PROFIT_TARGET"`).
    ```python
    def _determine_exit(...) -> Tuple[Optional[pd.Timestamp], Optional[float], str]:
        # ...
        if stop_loss_price and current_day["Low"] <= stop_loss_price:
            return current_day.name, stop_loss_price, "ATR_STOP_LOSS"
        # ...
        if profit_target_price and current_day["High"] >= profit_target_price:
            return current_day.name, profit_target_price, "PROFIT_TARGET"
        # ...
        return exit_date, exit_price, "MAX_HOLD_TIMEOUT"
    ```
*   **Status:** ✅ **PASS**

### Task 42: Update Orchestrator to Create Enriched `Trade` Objects

*   **Requirement:** The `Orchestrator` must gather all the new data points and pass them to the `ExecutionSimulator` to create the enriched `Trade` object.
*   **Verification:**
    1.  `praxis_engine/core/orchestrator.py`: The `_simulate_trade_from_signal` method correctly gathers all required data (scores, raw stats, exit reason).
    2.  `praxis_engine/services/execution_simulator.py`: The `simulate_trade` method was updated to accept all the new arguments and correctly passes them to the `Trade` constructor.
*   **Status:** ✅ **PASS**

---

### Task 43: Implement CSV Export in `main.py` and Refactor Reporting for Performance

*   **Requirement:** The `backtest` CLI command should export a `trade_log.csv`. The `ReportGenerator` should be refactored to use a Pandas DataFrame for performance.
*   **Verification:**
    1.  `praxis_engine/main.py`: The `backtest` command now correctly converts trade objects to dictionaries, aggregates them, creates a DataFrame, and saves it to `results/trade_log.csv`.
    2.  `praxis_engine/services/report_generator.py`: The `generate_backtest_report` and `_calculate_kpis` methods were refactored to accept a `pd.DataFrame` and now use vectorized Pandas operations for calculations.
*   **Status:** ✅ **PASS**

### Conclusion

All tasks within Epic 11 have been implemented completely and correctly according to the specifications in `docs/tasks.md`.
