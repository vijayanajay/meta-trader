**Praxis Engine — Log of Failed Experiments**

## Philosophy

This document is the project's scientific logbook of falsified hypotheses. It is not a list of mistakes, but a record of learning. In quantitative research, a well-designed experiment that fails is more valuable than a poorly-designed one that succeeds by chance. Each entry here represents a hypothesis that was tested against market data and proven incorrect.

We maintain this log to adhere to two core principles:
1.  **Scientific Integrity (The Hinton Principle):** Falsification is progress. By documenting what does not work, we refine our understanding of what does and avoid re-testing flawed ideas.
2.  **Pragmatic Engineering (The Nadh Principle):** Don't repeat stupid mistakes. This log serves as a guardrail against re-implementing logic that has already been demonstrated to be unprofitable or conceptually unsound.

### Experiment (Task 24): Fixed Reward:Risk Ratio Profit Target

*   **Hypothesis:** A fixed, symmetrical reward:risk ratio (e.g., 2:1) would improve risk-adjusted returns by enforcing a disciplined exit strategy, forcing the system to hold winning trades for larger gains.

*   **Implementation:** The `Orchestrator` was modified to calculate a profit target price based on a multiple of the risk taken (distance from entry to the ATR stop-loss). For example, if the risk was ₹10 per share, a 2:1 target would be set at `entry_price + ₹20`.

*   **Outcome & Evidence:** The backtest revealed a catastrophic drop in all performance metrics. The hypothesis was **conclusively falsified**. The change was immediately **reverted**.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** A fundamental mismatch between the strategy's nature and the exit logic was identified.
    *   **The Strategy:** Our system is a **mean-reversion** strategy. It profits from short-term, sharp reversions back to a statistical mean. The statistical edge is temporary.
    *   **The Exit Logic:** A fixed reward:risk ratio is a **trend-following** concept. It assumes that a price move will continue in the same direction.
    *   **The Conflict:** This exit logic forced the mean-reversion strategy to hold winning trades for too long, waiting for large, trend-like profit targets that rarely materialized. This caused profitable trades to decay, turning large unrealized gains into smaller wins or even losses as the stock inevitably reverted again.

*   **Lesson Learned:** Exit logic *must* be philosophically and mathematically consistent with the entry signal. Do not apply trend-following exit concepts to mean-reversion strategies.

### Experiment (Task 30): Mean-Reversion Profit Target (Exit at Middle Bollinger Band)

*   **Hypothesis:** Since the strategy is based on reversion to the mean, the most logical and safest exit point would be the moment the price successfully reverts to its statistical mean (the middle Bollinger Band).

*   **Implementation:** The `Orchestrator._determine_exit` method was modified to trigger an exit if the price crossed above the middle Bollinger Band (`BBM`) after a long entry.

*   **Outcome & Evidence:** Catastrophic failure. This change is the direct cause of the poor performance in the `backtest_summary.md` report. The hypothesis was **conclusively falsified**.
    *   **Sharpe Ratio:** Collapsed from a profitable `1.20` (baseline) to an uninvestable `0.41`.
    *   **Maximum Drawdown:** Worsened from `-82.36%` to `-56.93%` (Note: baseline MDD was also very high, but the new logic did not fix it and destroyed returns).
    *   **Profit Factor:** Dropped from `1.63` (baseline) to `1.00` (a coin flip before costs).
    *   **The Smoking Gun (Risk/Reward Profile):**
        *   **Average Win:** Collapsed from **`+11.62%`** to **`+3.19%`**.
        *   **Average Loss:** Remained stable (`-5.91%` vs. `-5.22%`).
        *   **Average Holding Period:** Plummeted from `37.95 days` to `8.26 days`.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** This experiment represents the opposite error of Task 24. Instead of holding too long, this logic exits far too early.
    *   **The Strategy:** The entry signal bets on a full reversion cycle. The profit is generated by the amplitude of this reversion.
    *   **The Exit Logic:** Exiting at the mean (`BBM`) systematically cuts every winning trade short. It accepts the full risk of the initial deviation but only captures the bare minimum of the subsequent reversion.
    *   **The Conflict:** The resulting risk/reward profile is mathematically guaranteed to fail. The average loss is now significantly larger than the average win (`-5.22%` vs. `+3.19%`). No win rate can overcome such a skewed P/L structure.

*   **Lesson Learned:** The profit in a mean-reversion trade is realized by the full amplitude of the reversion cycle, not just the return *to* the mean. Exit logic must be designed to capture a significant portion of this reversion, not just its beginning. An exit must be symmetrical to the entry's premise.
